Build the neural network prediction model with the TensorFlow for predicting the expected medical costs based on the dataset contains 1,338 patient information across the four major U.S. geographical regions. 

The medical costs in the dataset have $13,270 on mean value, but $12,110 on standard deviation. 

With the large polarization of the data values in mind, the trained model achieves the prediction with around $3,072 difference. The model is trained with three hidden layers and all of them have the ReLU activation.
